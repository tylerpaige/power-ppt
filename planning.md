# TO DO
- Put caps on the first and last slides so people can't go beyond what's available




# STRUCTURE

first level --> progression is by siblings
second level --> tangents are by children
third level --> 


structure
1 -
2  |- all connected by R/L
3  |- all slides in progression

 a. tangent -                      |
 b. tangent  |- connected by U/D   |- connected by R/L in the origin scope
 c. tangent -                      |

 a. tangent  (press down to get here from 1)
   i. prog of tan (press right to get here from 1.a)
      â€¢ tangent of prog of tan (press down to get here from 1.a.i)
   ii. prog of tan (press right to get here from 1.a.i)

At any point, right progress you through an idea (next sibling in a container)
and down brings you on a tangent (first child)
