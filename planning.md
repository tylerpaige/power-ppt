# TO DO
- Add README
- Turn into plugin for easy use in new projects
- Release dependency on keypress.js
- Figure out how to handle multiple, fast key strokes
    - Proposal: listen for number of key strokes, and then animate based on that... (maybe?)
    - Perhaps a throttle?
- Slight problem: it SHOULD be that the most recent target should have the highest z-index
- Quickly switching right and then left. Doesn't work! I need a better way to control quick key inputs. Like... have the switches be functions that have a parameter, and have the key events just count what number to pass to the functions. Still, I like the idea of the action being fairly instantaneous



# STRUCTURE

first level --> progression is by siblings
second level --> tangents are by children
third level -->

At any point, right progress you through an idea (next sibling in a container)
and down brings you on a tangent (first child)
